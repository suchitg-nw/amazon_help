A return pick-up can fail due to any of the following reasons:

    Customer not available during pick-up slot: In case you were not available, Delivery Agents will try up to three attempts to reschedule pick-up after calling and confirming with you. After three failed attempts, the pick-up will be cancelled.
    Product verification failed: Delivery Agent will check the product during pick-up. If the verification fails, because the product is not in its original state (has been used, missing price tags etc.,) the delivery agent may cancel the pick-up.
    Return pickup cancelled by Amazon: At times the pick-up may get cancelled or cannot be attempted due to operational reasons.

If your return pick-up has failed - you can follow below steps to start a new return pick-up request.

Before you place a new request, please ensure: The product is in original condition (with MRP/price tag intact) and you are available during the pick-up slot.

    Go to Online Returns Center.
    Select the item that you have scheduled for return.
    If the return request was approved, select View Return/Refund Status.
    Select Manage Return. Note: After you select "Manage Return" youâ€™ll have options to reschedule your pickup, make changes to your return or choose to no longer return the product.
    On the following page, select Cancel Return.
    Once the active return request is cancelled, you can create a new pick-up request in Online Returns Centre. To schedule a return, visit How to Schedule a Return help page.

If your order was not eligible for return pick-up and you have already shipped your item to be returned (using Self-Ship option), you will not be able to cancel your return.

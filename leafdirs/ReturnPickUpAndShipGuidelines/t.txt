Return Pickup Issues

A Return pick-up can fail due to various reasons such as:

    Customer not available
    Verification failed
    Return pickup cancelled

    In case you were not available during the chosen Return pick-up slot, the Delivery agent will try up to 3 reschedule attempts after calling and confirming with you. After 3 failed attempts, the pick-up will be cancelled.
    Delivery agent will check the product during the pickup. If the verification fails, because the product is not in it's original state (has been used, missing original tags etc.,) the delivery agent may cancel the pick-up.
    At times the pick-up attempt may be automatically cancelled or unattempted.

If you still want a Return Pickup, please reinitiate a fresh return once the existing request is cancelled. To do so -

    Go to Returns Centre.
    Select the item that you have scheduled for return.
    Select Cancel Return to reschedule your pickup, make changes to your return or choose to no longer want to return the product.

For a more detailed guidance on scheduling a return, visit the Help page: How to schedule a Return.
Self-Ship Guidelines

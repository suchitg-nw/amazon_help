About Tamper-Evident Packaging
Tamper-evident bags have unique package IDs. We pack your items securely inside these bags. The package ID is an alpha-numeric code that helps you to identify your order. If you suspect tampering, you can reject a package at the time of delivery.

We send your unique package ID via email and push notification when your order is out for delivery. You can also view the ID by selecting Track Package in Your Orders.

The center line between the blue sealing tapes is not pink, except at the edges.
Note: If the center line is pink, the package may have been tampered with. Don't accept delivery of this package.
The blue sealing tape does not show the word, "Tampered."

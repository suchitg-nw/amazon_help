Reason: Wrong jar/blade used

Remedy:

Check the user manual and make sure the correct jar/blade is being used for the food being processed.

Note: The blades on food processor could be causing a grinding or squealing sound when we operate it. The core of this issue is the shaft which can be attached to the motor by a stem. If this part becomes worn, cracked or broken, the motor can become overworked or misaligned, resulting in a grinding noise.

Note: The Join Waitlist button is only active when there are places available on the waitlist. The button is reactivated when new places become available on the waitlist.
To join a Lightning Deal waitlist:

Select Join Waitlist on a Lightning Deal.
When you're next on the waitlist, you'll see an alert in the upper right-hand corner of your Amazon page saying that the deal is available. If you have the latest Amazon app and have turned on notifications, you'll receive a notification on your phone.
Add the deal to your cart within the time limit. If you don't add the deal to your cart within the time limit, you'll be removed from the waitlist.
Complete your purchase and redeem the discount. If you don't complete the purchase within 15 minutes, the deal will be made available to the next customer on the waitlist.
Note:
Joining a waitlist doesn't guarantee that the deal will become available for purchase.
A waitlist expires when the promotion expires. All customers on the waitlist then lose their chance to claim the Lightning Deal.

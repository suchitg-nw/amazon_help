Lightning Deals are time-sensitive, so complete your order as soon as possible.

When a Lightning Deal is available, here's what you'll see:

The item featured in the deal.
Any available variations of the item (for example, different size or color).
The promotional discount amount and final price.
A status bar showing the percentage of deals already claimed .
A timer showing how long you have to claim the promotional discount.
An Add to Cart button, if there are available promotional discounts.
Note: When other customers hold all the promotional discounts for a Lightning Deal, you'll see a Join waitlist button and the status bar shows that 100% of the promotional discounts are held in other customer carts or have been used to purchase the deal.

Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging Programs

At Amazon, we obsess over providing a great packaging experience for customer orders. We listen to our customers to identify new ways to reduce waste, improve manufacturer packaging on items we sell, and innovate on the packaging we use in our fulfillment centers under our Frustration-Free Packaging Programs. We gather packaging insights via customer service, online returns, and social media to help us deliver the best possible experience while minimizing waste. One of the biggest challenges in e-commerce packaging is designing it to be as compact as possible while ensuring that products arrive fully intact. With this in mind, Amazon works with manufacturers worldwide to help them re-think and optimize their packaging, reduce waste throughout the supply chain, and protect products from damage during shipment to the customer.

Concerned about a Damaged Delivery or other issues with packaging?

While our mission is to reduce the amount of packaging required while ensuring products arrive to our customers undamaged, we recognize we don't always get it right. If you have experienced a damaged delivery, please contact us and tell us about your experience. We'll use information collected from your order to help assess both the quality of the item's packaging from the manufacturer and the choices we made about packaging solutions available at our fulfillment centers. We will work to improve the packaging, as needed, and may even restrict the item from sale until a packaging change is made to ensure that we are delivering a great customer experience.
